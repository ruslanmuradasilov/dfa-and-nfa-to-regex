# DFA and NFA to regular expression algorithm

The algorithm reads the DFA or NFA from a text file,
displays the image of the read DFA or NFA, transforms into regular expression and displays the result under image of DFA or NFA.
To display the graph, the **Graphviz** library is used.

The program is implemented as part of the [Pavel Panteleev](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/panteleev/)'s 'Compilers construction' course.
